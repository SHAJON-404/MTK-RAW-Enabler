# MTK RAW Enabler - Tecno Camon Series

This Magisk module enables RAW image capture on Tecno devices from the Camon series powered by MediaTek chipsets.

(And possibly others in the Camon series — please test and report!)

## How to Use

1. Download the RAW enabler module zip for your Camon model from the respective folder.  
2. Flash the module via Magisk (Modules → Install from Storage).  
3. Reboot your device.  
4. Open GCam or other camera apps supporting RAW, and enable the RAW/DNG option.  
5. Verify RAW support using the Camera2 Probe app if needed.

## Notes

- This module only enables RAW support via Camera2 API flags; hardware/kernel support is still required.  
- If RAW does not work after flashing, please open an issue with your device details.

## Contribution

Feel free to add modules for other Camon models or report issues on the repository.
